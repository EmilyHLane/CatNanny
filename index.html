          <h2>Meet the Cat Nanny</h2>
          <p>
            There have been cats in my family for the majority of my life,
            always adopted from a shelter, and usually two at a time. A few
            years ago, I decided to simplify my life and started my small
            business of being the Cat Nanny.
          </p>
          <p>
            My pets are Ashe and Shadow, and when I go on vacation, I need to
            know that they are taken care of and comfortable with their sitter
            who gives them special attention. This is what I will provide for
            your pets. You will be able to go on your work travel or vacation
            knowing that I am there taking care of your pets, following your
            routine and trying to make their lives as happy and comfortable as
            if you were there yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            I get great satisfaction from what I'm doing right now. Cats are
            such special animals with their own distinct personalities and
            truly fill my life with joy.

        <h3>SPCA Volunteer Cat Socializer</h3>
        <p>
          I volunteered as a cat socializer in Shelter Medicine at the SF SPCA
          for 4 years. I have had training in working with shy/undersocialized
          kittens and cats, affection eaters, and cats with aggressive
          behaviour or who get overstimulated easily. I have a very soft
          voice and gentle approach and am usually very successful in coaxing
          out even the shyest cat.

        Once I have taken care of someone's cats, they typically call on me
        several times a year, it seems to give them a secure feeling knowing
        that I'm there for them and their pets.

        <p class="h3 show">I am very impressed by Joyceâ€™s professionalism and her attentiveness to the needs of my two
          cats.She came over for an initial visit to meet our two cats and to hear their individual needs. When she came
          to take care of them she took video and pictures to send to us. It gave us comfort that they were doing great.
          I would most definitely recommend Joyce to take care of your pets.</p>
        <p class="h3 hide">The Cat Nanny was great to work with. She was responsive and provided photos and videos of
          her playing with my cats while I was gone.</p>
        <p class="h3 hide">Finding Joyce, "The Cat Nanny", has truly given me peace of mind to leave our very timid cat
          to travel. She took the time to meet with us, learn all about our cat and get to know us as well. Joyce is
          very knowledgeable about cats and cares about their well-being to the point of doing lots of things to make
          our little guy feel comfortable with her. She spent time talking with him and created some fun for him by
          putting treats where he could hunt them. She is pursuing her goal of having a relationship with him without
          him feeling uncomfortable. Within only a few days, she had him willing to stay just out of reach. (He is an
          11-year-old rescue cat who took 6 - 9 months to adjust to us.) I'm looking forward to not worrying - and our
          little guy being comfortable - when we are away. I highly recommend "The Cat Nanny"!!</p>
        <p class="h3 hide">The Cat Nanny was wonderful. Her fun videos and pics were welcome when we were away and
          reduced our anxiety about leaving her. Our cat was happy and healthy! We hope to be fortunate enough to use
          The Cat Nanny again. ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¸ (5 cat rating)</p>

        The first step I take as your cat nanny is a complimentary visit to
        introduce myself to your cat and learn more about what's needed to
        care for your cat. We'll review my cat care checklist that includes:
