            <h2>Meet the Cat Nanny</h2>
            <p>
              There have been cats in my family for the majority of my life,
              always adopted from a shelter, and usually two at a time. A few
              years ago, I decided to simplify my life and started my snall
              usiness of being the cat nanny.
            </p>
            <p>
              My pets right now are Ashe and Shadow, and when I go on vacation,
              I need to know that they are taken are of adn are comfortable with
              their sitter who gives them special attention. This is what I will
              provide for your pets. You will be able to go on your work travel
              or vacation knowing that I am there taking care of your pets,
              following your routine adn trying to make their lives as happy and
              comfortable as if you were there yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once I have taken care of someone's cats, they typically call on
              me several times a year, it seems to give them a secure feeling
              knowing that I'm there for them at their pets. I get great
              satisfaction from what I'm doing right now. Cats are such special
              animals with their own distinct personalities and truly fill my
              life with joy.

          <h3>SPCA Volunteer Cat Socializer</h3>
          <p>
            I volunteered as a cat socializer in Shelter Medicine at the SF SPCA
            for 4 years. I have had trining in working with shy/undersocialized
            kittens and cats, affection eaters, and cats with aggressive
            behaviour or who get overstimulated easitly. I have a very soft
            voice and gentle approach and am usually very successful in coaxing
            out even the shyest cat.

            care for your cat. We'll review my cat care checklist that includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your cat's personality traits</li>
            <li>Dietary requirements and feeding schedule</li>
            <li>Favorite toys and comfort items</li>
            <li>Emergency and vet contact information</li>
